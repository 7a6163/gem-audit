### 2.1.1 / 2026-02-16

#### Fixed

* Replaced `blocking-http-transport-curl` with `blocking-http-transport-reqwest-rust-tls`
  for HTTPS support. The curl backend required system OpenSSL, which broke
  cross-compilation for `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and failed at runtime on
  minimal Linux environments with `'https' is not compiled in`.

#### Changed

* Updated package description.
* Added `repository`, `homepage`, `keywords`, and `categories` metadata to
  `Cargo.toml` for crates.io publishing.
* Added CI, Codecov, Crates.io, and license badges to README.
* Added `codecov.yml` with coverage thresholds.

### 2.1.0 / 2026-02-15

#### Added

* **Semantic exit codes.** Exit code `0` = no vulnerabilities, `1` =
  vulnerabilities found, `2` = tool error, `3` = stale database. Previously
  all failures used exit code 1.
* **Severity threshold** (`--severity` / `-S`). Only report advisories at or
  above the given level (`none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`).
  Advisories without a CVSS score are excluded when a threshold is set.
* **Database staleness warning** (`--max-db-age <DAYS>`). Warns on stderr
  when the advisory database is older than the specified number of days.
  Combine with `--fail-on-stale` to exit with code 3.
  Also configurable via `max_db_age_days` in `.gem-audit.yml`.
* **Strict mode** (`--strict`). Treats version parse errors and advisory
  load failures as errors (exit code 2). Without this flag, they are
  silently skipped as before.
* Text output now shows a warnings summary line when version parse errors
  or advisory load errors occur (e.g., "Warnings: 3 version parse errors").
* JSON output now includes a `metadata` object with `version_parse_errors`
  and `advisory_load_errors` counts.

### 2.0.0 / 2026-02-13

#### Changed

* **Renamed project from `bundler-audit` to `gem-audit`.**
  Binary, crate name, and all CLI output now use the `gem-audit` name.
* Changed default configuration file from `.bundler-audit.yml` to
  `.gem-audit.yml`. The legacy `.bundler-audit.yml` is still loaded
  automatically as a fallback for backward compatibility.
* Changed environment variable from `BUNDLER_AUDIT_DB` to `GEM_AUDIT_DB`.
* Changed license from GPL-3.0-or-later to MIT.

### 1.2.0 / 2026-02-12

#### Changed

* Migrated all 7 error types to [thiserror], replacing ~124 lines of
  hand-written `impl Display`, `impl Error`, and `impl From` boilerplate
  with derive macros (`#[error("...")]`, `#[from]`).

### 1.1.0 / 2026-02-12

#### Changed

* Migrated from `git2` (libgit2 C bindings) to [gix] (gitoxide), a pure
  Rust git implementation. This eliminates OpenSSL and libssh2 system
  dependencies, enabling clean cross-compilation for all targets.

#### Added

* Added GitHub Actions CI workflow: `cargo check`, `cargo fmt --check`,
  `cargo clippy -D warnings`, and `cargo test` across Linux, macOS, and
  Windows.
* Added GitHub Actions release workflow: cross-compiles for 5 targets
  (`x86_64-linux`, `aarch64-linux`, `x86_64-darwin`, `aarch64-darwin`,
  `x86_64-windows`) and uploads binaries to GitHub Releases on tag push.
* Added performance benchmarks (`benchmarks/bench.sh`) using hyperfine.
* Added `LICENSE.md` (GPL-3.0-or-later).

### 1.0.0 / 2026-02-11

Initial release -- a complete Rust rewrite of [bundler-audit] v0.9.x.

#### Core

* Implemented RubyGems `Gem::Version` parsing and comparison semantics,
  including inline alphanumeric segments and pre-release ordering.
* Implemented `Gem::Requirement` with all 7 operators
  (`=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `~>`).
* Implemented `Gemfile.lock` parser as a state-machine with indentation
  tracking. Handles GEM, GIT, PATH sections, platform variants, pinned
  dependencies, and compound version constraints.
* Implemented advisory YAML deserialization with vulnerability checking
  (`patched_versions`, `unaffected_versions`) and CVSS v3/v2 criticality.
* Implemented advisory database management using [gix] (gitoxide) for
  clone and fast-forward update of [ruby-advisory-db].
* Implemented scanner that ties lockfile and database together:
  * Detects insecure gem sources (`git://` and `http://` protocols).
  * Checks each gem against the advisory database.
  * Ignores internal/private sources (RFC 1918, RFC 4193, RFC 6890 IP ranges).
  * Supports ignore lists by advisory ID (CVE, GHSA, OSVDB).
* Added `.gem-audit.yml` configuration file support with strict
  YAML validation. CLI `--ignore` takes precedence over the config file.

#### CLI

* Added `gem-audit check` command (also the default when no subcommand
  is given), with options:
  * `--quiet` / `-q` to suppress output.
  * `--verbose` / `-v` to show full advisory descriptions.
  * `--ignore` / `-i` to ignore specific advisory IDs.
  * `--update` / `-u` to update the database before checking.
  * `--database` / `-D` to specify a custom advisory database path.
  * `--format` / `-F` to select output format (`text` or `json`).
  * `--gemfile-lock` / `-G` to specify a custom lockfile path.
  * `--config` / `-c` to specify a custom configuration file path.
  * `--output` / `-o` to write output to a file.
* Added `gem-audit update` command.
* Added `gem-audit download` command.
* Added `gem-audit stats` command.
* Added `gem-audit version` command.
* Auto-downloads [ruby-advisory-db] on first run if not present.
* TTY detection for ANSI color output and JSON pretty-printing.

#### Output Formats

* Text format with ANSI color highlighting for criticality levels.
* JSON format with gem info, advisory details, and CVSS scores.
